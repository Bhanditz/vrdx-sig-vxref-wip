This is a work-in-progress within the [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/) [VRDX SIG](https://www.first.org/global/sigs/vrdx "VRDX SIG").

Each collaborator should create their own top level directory within the repository and perform their work there. At some point in the future we will likely want to consolidate into a more unified directory structure, but for now it's probably better to keep things separate.
